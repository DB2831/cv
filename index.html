    <p>Hi, my name is Dwayne and I’m a photographer. I enjoy hikes, beach walks, dogs, motorcycles- pretty much anything
        outdoors. I also love photography. It’s something that I fell in love with instantly and it’s been a great
        journey ever since.
        I shoot both film and digital photography but recently got into drone photography and videography as well. I
        really enjoy the editing process of photos and videos just as much as going out and just getting some awesome
        shots.

        I’m here to provide information and sort of like a journal for other photographers (or anyone interested in
        photography). So feel free to follow me along on this ride!</p>
